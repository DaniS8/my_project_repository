# My Project
For my project, I will analyze performance data using R. To analyze this data, you will load it, clean it, build a matrix and then plot the data. 
There are some R packages that need to be installed in order to properly analyze this data.

You will need to install the following packages in R: "readxl"  for reading excel doc, "tm" for text mining, "SnowballC" for text stemming, "wordcloud" for word-cloud generator, "RColorBrewer" for color palettes, "syuzhet" for sentiment analysis, "sentimentr"  for sentiment analysis, "ggplot2" for plotting graphs, and "dplyr".



# Execute the analysis
To execute the analysis, from the project folder you can run:

```{r}
Rscript -e "rmarkdown::render('HW2_up.Rmd')"
```
